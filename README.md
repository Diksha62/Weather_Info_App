Weather Info App Using React:
The Weather Info App provides users with a convenient and user-friendly way to access up-to-date weather information for different locations, enhancing their ability to plan and prepare for various weather conditions
The Weather Info App is a simple web application built using React.
It allows users to search for weather information based on city names.
The app utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data.
Users can input a city name and click the search button to retrieve weather information.
The app displays temperature, humidity, pressure, and weather description for the searched city.
It dynamically updates the background image based on the weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy).
The UI components are built using Material-UI for a clean and responsive design.
State management is handled using React hooks like useState for managing input fields and fetching weather data.
Error handling is implemented to display a message if the searched city is not found or if there's an issue fetching data.
The app is designed to provide a user-friendly experience for quickly accessing weather information
